# codequiz
The assignment wanted us to create a quiz where the user could answer questions on coding, beat the timer, and store the highest score. For this assignment we had to create a timed quiz that would bring each question up one at a time and store the players highest score.

Through YouTube tutorials and the help of my peers, I was able to create a visually appealing game with Bootstrap for styling. However, I struggled with the timer function. Ideally, this timer would start as the user started the quiz, and give them a set amount of time before they finish the quiz.

What I was able to successfully execute, were multiple functions in Javascript that caused questions to come up in random orders, to track what question the user is on, and attempted to locally store the user data. I also added timer but struggled to get it to deploy.
